!-- Past Project - The Dirty Crow Inn was a quick project started and completed December 2018.  It was a personal challenge

!--Current Project - Bodine Elementary School (a 501c3 project) - with the help of established web developer we are in the process of 
!--completely creating a new website that demonstrates the purpose and value of the school and addresses all the information
!-- needed to be dsplayed by an educational facility.  This project will delve deeper into UX/UI elements and push my personal limits
!-- and use of HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Content Management and much more.

!-- About Me- Originally a historian by trade I am setting out to learn more about the web and create original content
!-- to benefit those in need of an online, social presence. A huge advocate for small business I recognize the need
