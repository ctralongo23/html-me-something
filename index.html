                    background in historical and cultural analysis.  When I moved to Memphis my goals were to continue researching but 
                    I then found myself becoming a beer specialist for local brewery, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.highcottonbrewing.com">High Cotton Brewing Company</a></i>.
                    It was at High Cotton that I met my wonderful partner in crime, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://maxkarimnia.com">Max</a></i> and gained a passion for all things web development. Together
                    we share a passion for our pets (3 cats and 2 dogs), anything outdoors, video games, beer and, of course, web development.

                        Web development has become a new passion for me and I am striving to learn everything I can.  I am very fortunate to 
                        have help from close sources, as well as the journery I have had through Launch Code.  Prior to attending Launch Code 
                        I have mainly been a self taught web developer (and have miles to go).  Below are two examples of past past Projects
                        I worked on to start my learning process with HTML/CSS.

                        Since I am always working to expand my craft I am currently immersed in a number of projects.  Each project seeks to reinforce
                        what I already know but it also teaches me new things.  I learn a lot from my mistakes and have been known to look at past code from 
                        exervices I have done as well as use every resource in the world to make my code more complete.  These are projects are all still in
                        their infancy but I am excited to see the path each one will take to completion.
