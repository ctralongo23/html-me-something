                    <strong class="I">I</strong> am just a girl from Wyoming making dreams come true in Memphis, TN. I have a strong
                    background in historical and cultural analysis.  When I moved to Memphis my goals were to continue researching but 
                    I then found myself becoming a beer specialist for local brewery, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.highcottonbrewing.com">High Cotton Brewing Company</a></i>.
                    It was at High Cotton that I met my wonderful partner in crime, <i><a target="_blank" href="https://maxkarimnia.com">Max</a></i> and gained a passion for all things web development. Together
                    we share a passion for our pets (3 cats and 2 dogs), anything outdoors, video games, beer and, of course, web development.

                        Web development has become a new passion for me and I am striving to learn everything I can.  I am very fortunate to 
                        have help from close sources, as well as the journery I have had through Launch Code.  Prior to attending Launch Code 
                        I have mainly been a self taught web developer (and have miles to go).  Below are two examples of past past Projects
                        I worked on to start my learning process with HTML/CSS.

!-- Past Project - The Dirty Crow Inn was a quick project started and completed December 2018.  It was a personal challenge
!-- to create a website that was simple but expressed the purpose of a business I had a personal connection to.  To date
!-- the website is still in active use by the busisness owner to represent his online presence, menu and event calendar.

!-- Past Project - Beginner's consult on the creation of The Anonymous Bartender.  This is a personal project that is still evolving
!-- outside of web development.  It is set up to be the host page for a podcast that is currently in production and building
!-- up a following.  It is considered a beginners consulting project due the help I provided and initial building but main framework
!-- and harder coding was done by a seasoned web developer as a free-lance project.

!-- Current Project - The development of my personal website - Inpurrnet.  Creation of a platform to identify myself 
!-- as a freelancer to jumpstart a career in front end web development.  Current page is the template for moving into 
!-- the final product.

!--Current Project - Mini Momentos - From start to finish a pro bono website being created for a business acquaintance to showcase
!-- their self-employed livelyhood.  This project is currently in brainstorm phase while I wait for client to return information regarding
!-- content, purpose, images, color scheme.  It will eventually be a platform to demonstrate Artist Bio, Current Artist Work and will become
!-- online store.  This will be coupled with the onboarding of Word Press and Shopify.

!--Current Project - Bodine Elementary School (a 501c3 project) - with the help of established web developer we are in the process of 
!--completely creating a new website that demonstrates the purpose and value of the school and addresses all the information
!-- needed to be dsplayed by an educational facility.  This project will delve deeper into UX/UI elements and push my personal limits
!-- and use of HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Content Management and much more.

!-- About Me- Originally a historian by trade I am setting out to learn more about the web and create original content
!-- to benefit those in need of an online, social presence. A huge advocate for small business I recognize the need
!-- for a clear cut platform to demonstrate
